Plagiarism Detector takes in 2 Python or C++ projects and detects any potential plagiarism between them.

Application is written using Java and ANTLR.

ANTLR is used to parse the code from the two projects into ASTs (abstract syntax trees) for comparison.

The web interface, written using HTML and CSS, allows the user to upload two projects and displays potential plagiarism.
